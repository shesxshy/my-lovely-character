            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
                Morticia is the matriarch of the Addams family. Loving wife and dedicated mother, Morticia has the ability of making the strongest men cry on their knees begging for forgiveness :)
                <br>
                She frequently enjoys cutting the buds off of roses, which she discards (keeping only the stems), likes cutting out paper dolls with three heads and making sweaters with three arms, collecting the mail from the hand-in-the-box Thing, and cooking unusual concoctions for her husband, including eye of newt.
            </p>
